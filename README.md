Data Source The data set we provided by: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
Introduction This assignment will give you a chance to explore the topics covered in week 2 of the course by visualizing some data as a chart. The data set we provided deals with world temperatures and comes from NASA: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/. Alternatively you can use any data that you would like to explore. You are not required to use D3.js, but if you would like to, we have provided some helpful resources that will make it easier for you to create a visualization. You are welcome to use the additional resources, especially if you do not want to program to complete this project.
Goals The goal of this assignment is to give you some experience with handling and deciding how to visualize some data and for you to get a feel for the various aspects of the visualization.
